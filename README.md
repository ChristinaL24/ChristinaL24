### 📝 Get to Know Me!
Welcome! I'm Christina!

Prior to entering the web development space, I was originally working towards pursuing higher education in hopes of working with the pediatric age range within the healthcare setting. Per the recommendation of a friend, I learned how to code during the pandemic and was blown away by how fun it was. To be able to see the end result of your work was different from what I was use to. Although I am no longer pursuing this goal, my love for studying pediatrics and healthcare remain the same!
